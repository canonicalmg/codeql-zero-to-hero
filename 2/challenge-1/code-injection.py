It seems like you are concerned about code injection vulnerability due to user-provided input. To provide a solution, I need to see the actual code. However, I can give you a general approach to prevent code injection in Python.

1. Validate and sanitize user input: Always validate user input and ensure it meets the expected format. You can use regular expressions or built-in functions like `str.isalnum()` to check if the input contains only alphanumeric characters.

2. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements: When working with databases, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate user input from the actual query. This prevents SQL injection attacks.

3. Avoid using `eval()` and `exec()`: These functions can execute arbitrary code and should be avoided. If you must use them, make sure to properly sanitize and validate the input.

4. Use secure libraries and functions: Use libraries and functions that are designed to handle user input securely. For example, use `html.escape()` to safely escape HTML characters in user input.

If you can provide the actual code, I can give you a more specific solution.
