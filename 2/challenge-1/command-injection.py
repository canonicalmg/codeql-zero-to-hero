It seems like you are facing a command injection vulnerability issue due to the use of user-provided input in your code. To fix this issue, you should validate and sanitize the user input before using it in your code. Here's a possible solution:

1. Import the `shlex` library to help with input sanitization.
2. Use the `shlex.quote()` function to sanitize the user-provided input before using it in your code.

Here's an example of how you can modify your code:

```python
import os
import shlex

# Get user input
user_input = input("Please enter a command: ")

# Sanitize user input
sanitized_input = shlex.quote(user_input)

# Execute the command with sanitized input
os.system(sanitized_input)
```

This will ensure that the user-provided input is properly sanitized and safe to use in your code, preventing command injection attacks.
