It seems you are concerned about SQL injection in your Flask application. To fix this issue, you should use parameterized queries instead of directly using user-provided values in your SQL query. This will help prevent SQL injection attacks.

Here's an example of how to modify your code using parameterized queries with the `sqlite3` library:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
import sqlite3

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/search', methods=['GET'])
def search():
    search_query = request.args.get('query')
    
    # Connect to the database
    conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Use a parameterized query instead of directly using the user-provided value
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE column_name = ?", (search_query,))

    results = cursor.fetchall()

    # Close the connection
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()

    return str(results)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this example, the `?` is a placeholder for the user-provided value, and the value is passed as a tuple `(search_query,)` to the `execute()` method. This way, the `sqlite3` library will automatically escape any potentially harmful characters, preventing SQL injection attacks.
