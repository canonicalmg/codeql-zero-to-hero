It seems like you are facing an SQL injection issue in your Flask application. To fix this error, you should use parameterized queries instead of directly using user-provided values in your SQL query. This will prevent SQL injection attacks.

Here's an example of how to modify your code using parameterized queries with the `sqlite3` library:

1. First, import the `sqlite3` library in your Flask application:

```python
import sqlite3
```

2. Next, let's assume you have a user-provided value called `user_value`. Instead of directly using it in your SQL query, use a parameterized query like this:

```python
# Connect to your SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Use a parameterized query instead of directly using the user-provided value
query = "SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE your_column = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (user_value,))

# Fetch the results and close the connection
results = cursor.fetchall()
conn.close()
```

By using parameterized queries, you can prevent SQL injection attacks and fix the error in your code. Make sure to replace `your_database.db`, `your_table`, and `your_column` with the appropriate values for your specific application.
